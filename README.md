# Local CDN for single spa

I was on a roadtrip, and wanted to work a on application with no internet access whatsoever.
I thought I would be able to work on the app and get the local server up.
But the application was dependent on single-spa via CDN.
So I created a servor application which basically hosts all the files on a local port. This way I was able to get the local development env working without internet.
